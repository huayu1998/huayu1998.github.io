Hey! I'm Huayu Liang, a Master's student in Computer Science focusing specifically on Software Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). I'm currently working with Dr.Chris Brown in the [**Code World, No Blanket**](https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/team.html) lab, and I've been a GTA for the CS1054 - Intro to Java and am currently TA for the CS5764 - Information Visualization.

\
**Fun facts** about me: In middle school, I came to the United States for a summer camp as an international student, and that was a great experience in my life. I decided to study abroad in the U.S. for an undergraduate degree to broaden my horizons and study Western culture. I like doing Yoga while free and I love traveling and extreme sports such as bungee jumping, skydiving, and so on. I'd like to make friends and I am a person that is easy to go along with. Besides, I quit sugar for a couple of years to keep healthy for my diet and skin :)
